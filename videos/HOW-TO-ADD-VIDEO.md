# How to Add Your Video Background

Your website is already set up to display a video background in the hero section. The video files couldn't be downloaded automatically due to connectivity issues, but you can easily add them yourself.

## Option 1: Add Your Own Video Files

1. **Get your video files** (wedding/garden venue footage)
   - You can film your own venue
   - Or download free stock videos from:
     - **Pexels**: https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/wedding%20venue/
     - **Pixabay**: https://pixabay.com/videos/search/garden%20wedding/
     - **Mix kit**: https://mixkit.co/free-stock-video/wedding/

2. **Place the video in this folder** (`videos/`)
   - Name it: `hero-video.mp4`
   - Optional: Also add `hero-video.webm` for better browser compatibility

3. **Refresh your browser** - The video will automatically play!

## Option 2: Use a YouTube/Vimeo Embed

If you have a video on YouTube or Vimeo, I can help you embed it instead.

## Option 3: Create a GIF

If you prefer a looping GIF instead of video:
1. Create or download a GIF
2. Place it in the `images/` folder as `hero-background.gif`
3. Update line 40 in `index.html` to point to this GIF

## Current Status

Right now, your website shows:
- ✅ A beautiful Unsplash image as the background
- ✅ An animated gradient overlay for visual interest
- ✅ All the video infrastructure is ready - just drop in your video file!

## Recommended Video Specifications

- **Format**: MP4 (H.264) or WebM
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (Full HD)
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds (will loop automatically)
- **File Size**: Under 5MB for fast loading
- **Frame Rate**: 24-30fps
- **No audio needed** (video is muted for autoplay)
